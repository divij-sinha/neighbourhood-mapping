            <h2>
            Where are Chicago's neighborhoods?
            </h2>
            Chicago prides itself as “The City of Neighborhoods” but where are they? 
            There are no official neighborhood boundaries, other than the “Community Areas” mapped out in the 1920s! 
            Chicago needs an update.
