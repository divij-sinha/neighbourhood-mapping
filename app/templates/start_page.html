  Chicago prides itself as “The City of Neighborhoods” but where are they? 
  Chicago needs an update from the 77 community areas mapped in the 1920s!

</p>
<p class="fs-4 lead p-3">
  The purpose of this survey is to better understand — and support — Chicago's neighborhoods. 
  We're asking current Chicago residents to identify Chicago's neighborhoods using an 
  interactive map to draw neighborhood boundaries.
