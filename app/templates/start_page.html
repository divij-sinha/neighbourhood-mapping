<p class="fs-4 lead p-3">
  Chicago prides itself as “The City of Neighborhoods” but where are they?
  Other than the 77 “Community Areas” mapped out in the 1920s, no official
  neighborhood boundaries exist. Chicago needs an update!
</p>
<p class="fs-4 lead p-3">
  This project asks current Chicago residents to identify Chicago's
  neighborhoods using an interactive map to draw neighborhood boundaries.
